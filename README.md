Get the sausage

Get into a fresh directory and try this baby. You might want to have the
environment variables `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` set beforehand
for the smoothest experience.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlipps/sausage-bun/master/givememysausage.php | php
```

Or (to automatically configure Sauce as part of the installation):

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlipps/sausage-bun/master/givememysausage.php | \
SAUCE_USERNAME=xxxx \
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=yyyy \
